Some stuff that we would integrate in future version:

- Setup OSD for managing the submenu
- reload the config file when opening mainmenu (only when menu configuration has been changed - checking timestamp of xml!)
- Enable / Disable in OSD-Setup
- When leaving a sub menu position the selection to the menu entry (requires the patch to be changed)
- const correctness!
