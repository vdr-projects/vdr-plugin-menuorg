Some Stuff that whe would integrade in future version:

- Setup OSD for managing the submenu
- reload the config file when openuing mainmenu (only when menu configuration has been changed - checking timestamp of xml!)
- alternate titles for plugins
- command handling like the setup plugin
- Enable / Disable in OSD-Setup
